# Panel cladding layer standard TEST

Plan: [261023_PLAN_panel-cladding-layer-standard](../../Project_Plan/261023_PLAN_panel-cladding-layer-standard.md)

Managed regression for the project layer standard:

| Objects | Layer |
| --- | --- |
| Source panels | `<PROJECT>-IEF-Wireframe::Surfaces - PNL::Surfaces - <type>` |
| Extrusion curves | `<PROJECT>-IEF-Wireframe::Curves - PNL::Curves - <type>` |
| Cladding surfaces | `Reference::Surfaces - STEP::Surfaces - <prefix>::<material>` |

`bkt-layer-standard.json` is a read-only capture from the live
`BKT - Wireframe.3dm` on 2026-10-23: the complete layer list, the six observed
panel-layer → curve-layer pairs (joined by PID over 849 configured panels), and
every `Cladding` value/layer pair (STEP output and the wireframe glass copies).
It contains no geometry. The smoke asserts that the plug-in's planners reproduce
the live pairings, that panel/curve/STEP scopes select exactly 9/18/21 BKT layers,
that wireframe copies stay outside managed scope, that retired trees fail closed,
that colours/workbook categories are unchanged, and that a real BKT WT_11 panel
plans `Reference::Surfaces - STEP::Surfaces - MPL|LVR` surfaces and
`Curves - WT_11` curves. It also scans `src/` for the retired layer names.

```powershell
dotnet run --project Project_Test/261023_TEST_panel-cladding-layer-standard/PanelCladdingLayerStandardSmoke.csproj -c Debug
dotnet run --project Project_Test/261023_TEST_panel-cladding-layer-standard/PanelCladdingLayerStandardSmoke.csproj -c Release
```

No Rhino native runtime is required. Live command acceptance (PCSpawnCrv/
PCSpawnSrf/PCUpdate/PCSyncSrf/PCpid in Rhino) needs the 1.0.98 RHP installed and is
recorded separately in the EXET.
